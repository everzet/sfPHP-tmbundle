_New TextMate bundle for PHP_

Requirements
------------------
The only & strongest requirement for sfPHP bundle is to turning of the default PHP bundle, because syntax descriptor & almost all snippets will conflct with it.
To turn off default PHP bundle in TextMate open `Bundles -> Bundle Editor -> Show Bundle Editor`, there click `Filter List...` in left bottom corner & unset checkbox near `PHP`, click `Done` & you're done :-)
